## Monthly Balance Project

The Monthly Balance Project is a basic, one-page JavaScript app. It allows the user to add and remove incomes and expenses, and calculate the balance for the ongoing month.

## Motivation

The project was made after the fifth week of the IT Bootcamp's Front End Development Course as the first big project in plain JavaScript. Also, it is the first major one to utilize JS modules.

## Build status

The project is considered finished, and there won't be any expansions in terms of features. The project was overhauled recently with responsive design and code cleanup.

## Tech/framework used

This project was done in JavaScript, without the use of any frameworks or libraries. Vanilla CSS was used for styling.
